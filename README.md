This project was completed with the incorporation of cocoapods that assissted both with some basic UI elements as well as the backend to Firebase. Part of the challenge with this one was getting the message cells to show up correctly both when still and scrolling. The contents of each are reliant on Firebase calls to populate each with the correct data. This app also incorporates the use of segues to navigate between multiple screens, which was rather simple to set up since no data is being passed forwards or backwards during the navigation. Overall this was a fun project that got me more comfortable with Swift and Xcode.
